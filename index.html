<h1>The Pineapple</h1>

<p>The pineapple is a great and majestic fruit. It's hometown is Hawaii. It had a yellow egg like shape at the bottom but is a lot larger that an egg. The bottom part is yellow and has spikes. These spikes prtect it from harms way. The top part is a tower of green, spiky leaves. </p>
